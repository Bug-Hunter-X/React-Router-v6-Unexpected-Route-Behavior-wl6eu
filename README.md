# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React Router v6 where a route, despite seemingly correct configuration, renders incorrectly or not at all.  The issue is subtle and may stem from interactions with other components or routing configurations.

## Problem

The `Contact` component is not rendering as expected, and I suspect this may be linked to the way the routes are declared in the app.  The issue is difficult to track down because other routes are working correctly.  Debugging tools do not return any useful errors.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for conflicting routes and ensuring the path definitions are precise and unambiguous.  In this case, a missing or misplaced component was the root cause.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe that the Contact page does not load as expected.
